## Manual For Matlab Codes of This Project

### Getting Started
- **Import the Code Files:** First, import the necessary Matlab code files into the present working directory of your Matlab workspace. The required files include:
  - `genMatrix.m`
  - `iterref.m`
  - `hign_cond.m`
  - `low_cond.m`
  - `small_size.m`
  - `large_size.m`

### Running Experiments
- **Execute Functions:** Follow the sequence order you wish to conduct the experiments. For example:
  - **Low Condition Number Matrix Experiment:** Open the `low_cond.m` function in Matlab and click the **Run** button in the editor. The results will be produced by the functions.
