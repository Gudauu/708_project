Manual For Matlab codes of this project:
Firstly, Users should import those codes file  into the present working directory of Matlab workspace. These files include genMatrix.m, iterref.m, lu_ir.m, gmres_ir.m, hign_cond.m, low_cond.m, small_size.m, large_size.m.
And then, according to the sequence order what you want to do the experiment, run the corresponding functions. For example, if users want to do the low condition numbered matrix experiment, they only need to open the low_cond.m function and then click "run" button in the editor of Matlab, the results will be produced by the functions.
